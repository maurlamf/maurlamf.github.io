		<p>About</p>

		<p>Hi my name is Mauricio Rivera and I'm a San Francisco native with interests in finance, technology, development, user interfaces, and sports.</p>

		<p>I recently moved back to San Francisco by way of Los Angeles.</p>

		<p>I have worked on a number of cool projects. Most recently I worked at <a href="http://www.goldsilver.com">GoldSilver.com</a>, a global gold and silver dealership, where I ran technology, user interface, and finance teams. I have done work as a financial and technology consultant, and previously I worked at Loyola Marymount University.</p>

		<p>I graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a BA and Loyola Marymount University where I earned an MBA with dual emphases in Finance and Decision Science. I am also a <a href ="http://www.cfainstitute.org">CFA</a> Charterholder.</p>


					<p class="articletext">Some of my favorite things include <a href="http://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, the San Francisco Giants, FC Barça, USMNT, <a href="http://github.com/maurlamf">github</a>, the San Francisco 49ers, chess, guitars, and Neal Stephenson books. I love Wong Kar Wai and Woody Allen films, Mexican food, <a href="http://longnow.org/">The Long Now Foundation</a>, and the Golden State Warriors.
