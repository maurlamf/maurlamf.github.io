		<p>Hi my name is <strong>Mauricio Rivera</strong> and I'm a San Francisco native with interests in finance, technology, development, user interfaces, and sports.</p>

		<p>I recently moved to San Francisco! </p>

		<p>I have worked on a number of cool projects. Most recently I worked at <a href="http://www.goldsilver.com">GoldSilver.com</a>, a global gold and silver dealership, where I ran technology, user interface, and finance teams. I have done work as a financial and technology consultant, and previously I worked at Loyola Marymount University. </p>

		<p>I'm interested in chess, sports, technology, numbers, films, and literature. Some of my favorite things are <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>, the San Francisco Giants, Bar√ßa FC, USMNT, <a href="http://github.com">github</a>, the Golden State Warriors, the San Francisco 49ers, <a href="http://www.songza.com">Songza</a>, Neal Stephenson books, <a href="http://longnow.org/">the Long Now Foundation</a>, and Mexican food.</p>
