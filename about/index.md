About

Hi my name is **Mauricio Rivera** and I'm a San Francisco native with interests in finance, technology, development, user interfaces, and sports.

I recently moved to San Francisco! 

I have worked on a number of cool projects. Most recently I worked at [GoldSilver.com](http://www.goldsilver.com), a global gold and silver dealership, where I ran technology, user interface, and finance teams. I have done work as a financial and technology consultant, and previously I worked at Loyola Marymount University. 

`I graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a BA and Loyola Marymount University where I earned an MBA with dual emphases in Finance and Decision Science. I am also a [CFA](http://www.cfainstitute.org) Charterholder.` 

I'm interested in chess, sports, technology, numbers, films, and literature. Some of my favorite things are [Pocket](http://getpocket.com), the San Francisco Giants, Bar√ßa FC, USMNT, [github](http://github.com), the Golden State Warriors, the San Francisco 49ers, [Songza](http://www.songza.com), Neal Stephenson books, [the Long Now Foundation](http://longnow.org/), and Mexican food.
