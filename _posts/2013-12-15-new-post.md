My dad worked during so many AT&T eras/permutations that its really hard to keep track. It started as the original Ma Bell AT&T, was split up in a 1984 antitrust case, became Pacific Telesis, then [Pac Bell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Bell) which was aquired by SBC (formerly Southwestern Bell). SBC eventually acquired the original divested AT&T to become AT&T once again. One of his many offices was 611 Folsom Street in San Francisco, which housed the now infamous [Room 641A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A).
