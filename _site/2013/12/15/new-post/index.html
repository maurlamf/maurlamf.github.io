<p>My dad worked during so many AT&amp;T eras/permutations that its really hard to keep track. It started as the original Ma Bell AT&amp;T, was split up in a 1984 antitrust case, became Pacific Telesis, then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Bell">Pac Bell</a> which was aquired by SBC (formerly Southwestern Bell). SBC eventually acquired the original divested AT&amp;T to become AT&amp;T once again. One of his many offices was 611 Folsom Street in San Francisco, which housed the now infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A">Room 641A</a>.
